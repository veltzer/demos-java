Messaging
Election Application
Exercise description:
Enclosed is a simple web application for managing elections. Each user can cast his vote to one
of the candidates. The system counts and presents the number of votes for each candidate.
Before accepting a vote, the system goes through a complex process of verifying the vote
legitimacy (see VotingBean.vote()). This process may take a long time making it difficult for
users to cast their votes. Under high loads, the voting request may even reach timeout, making it
practically impossible to vote.
Your mission is to use JMS to make the vote request asynchronous: the users vote will be saved
as a message in a persistent queue for future processing and the user will not have to wait.
