Modify the phonebook project and add different types of contacts:
	BasicContact -> this is the parent contact which only has phone and name.
	ArmyBuddy -> BasicContact + army id
	WorkRelated -> BasicContact + company
	ServiceProvider -> BasicContact + occupation (plumber, car repairman)

Take note of the following:
- now each line in your "address" on disk should be different according
to the type of contact.
- when the user enters a new contact, first ask the user what type of contact
he/she is about to enter.
- use polymorphism wherever you can.
