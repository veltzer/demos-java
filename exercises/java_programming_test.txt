Java basic course final test (Multiple choice test):

parameters of type float are passed to methods:
1. By reference
2. By auto-boxing to type Float
3. By value (correct)
4. By cloning

in java a class always inherits from:
1. zero or one class.
2. exactly one class (Object if not specified). (correct).
3. many interfaces.
4. exactly one interface.

when building a java stream (input or output) the order of encapsulation of streams:
(ObjectInputStream, GzipOutputStream, etc...).
1. doesn't matter (just the types matter).
2. matters only if you repeat clasess.
3. matters (correct).
4. doesn't matter at all.

variables of type String in java:
1. Are mutable.
2. Are immutable. (correct)
3. Are multable under cloning.
4. Are mutable or immutable according to whether you put the 'const' keyword in front of it.

When you create an instance in Java the data (fields) of this object are stored:
1. In the heap. (correct)
2. On the stack.
3. In the code segment.
4. In the data segment.

Objects in java are passed:
1. By reference (the references are passed by value). (correct).
2. By value.
3. By copy.
4. By name.

How many types of inner classes are there in Java?
1. Just one type (static).
2. Two types (static and non static). (give points for this too).
3. Three types (static, non static and anonymous) (correct)
4. No types - all inner classes are just regular classes.

The types Integer and int in Java:
1. Are the same (totally interchangeable).
2. Have many different features but are related language wise (storage, type). (correct).
3. Have many different features but are not related language wise.
4. Are the same but Integer is more advanced so you better use that and avoid using 'int'.

When Java objects are stored in a HashMap in Java:
1. You can change them in any way you see fit.
2. You can change attributes of them which do not effect their hash function.
3. If you want to change attributes which effect their hash function remove them from the hash, change and reinsert them.
4. 2 and 3 are correct (correct).

A abstract class in java:
1. May not implement any methods.
2. May not implement any interfaces.
3. May implement methods. (correct)
4. May not inherit from any class other than Object.
