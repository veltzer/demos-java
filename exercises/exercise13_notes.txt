Things to note in this exercise:
1. Synchronized blocks in both threads to make sure we make decisions correctly AND
to keep the underlying data structure intact.
2. Synchronized keyword used in the Bank singleton pattern that is required since we
are now threaded and the "if" statement in the getInstance method could do the
wrong thing.
