Create large arrays of integers with random data and copy data between them.
Do it in two ways:
- using System.arraycopy.
- using your own code.
Repeat and rinse.
Measure the time this takes. Use either:
	System.currentTimeMillis()
or
	System.nanoTime()
What are your results?
What do you think about the accuracy of your measurements?
