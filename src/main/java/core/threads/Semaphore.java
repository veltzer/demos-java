/**
 * An N semaphore. This class controls access to N resources. The number of
 * resources is set at construction time. Each request can be made to any number
 * of resources and the requester is blocked until he gets those resources. The
 * semaphore relies on everyone being "nice" in that they call the semaphore
 * correctly and state the same amount in the up up and down methods. This class
 * is not fair in the sense that many threads wanting little resources will
 * probably get them and thus starve a single thread which wants lots of
 * resources. An improvement could be a first come first serve fix.
